            To welcome the community with open arms. To train an army of people who are passionate about living out Godâ€™s purpose for their lives. To then give that army an outlet for sharing the love of Christ through outreach and missions.
            We believe everyone needs the hope Jesus offers, so our passion is to help people find that hope and grow in a relationship with Him. We emphasize grace and acceptance, as we help people understand who Jesus is and how to take the next right step in their journey of faith
