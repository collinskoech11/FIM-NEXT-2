                The Faith International Ministries Church wants to do everything we can to ensure that our communities are taking the necessary precautions to slow the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, we want to make it possible for everyone to experience the fellowship and Biblical teaching that keeps our faith strong, which is more important now than ever. With this in mind, we are ready to offer a series of special live stream worship services, Sundays at 11am GMT+3. These will take the place of in-person services for all of our Bay Area locations. We hope youâ€™ll join us online!
